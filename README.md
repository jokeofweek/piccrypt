# PicCrypt 0.3.0

PicCrypt (Programmed and created by Dominic Charley-Roy a.k.a. JokeofWeek) 
is a FREE (and will remain that way) software allowing you to compile any file into
a 24-bit Bitmap file and back. Before your file is converted into an image, it is
compressed using the zLib compression utility. PicCrypt also lets you encrypt your
images with a home-made XOR encryption method. The source for this encryption 
method is located on the same site as PicCrypt.

Note that the original version of this software is free and open source, and is
released under the MIT license. For more information about this, please see the 
LICENSE file.

USING PICCRYPT TO CONVERT A FILE INTO A PICTURE:
The conversion process is fairly simple. Open up picCrypt, go to the Convert To
box and (if you want to encrypt your file, enter your encryption key here) 
choose a size for your output image. Once you have chosen the size, click
Choose file to pick your file. Once you have chosen your file, it will ask you to
choose the location and the name of the image file that will be created. Once
you have chosen this, the file will be converted.
